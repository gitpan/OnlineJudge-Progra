OnlineJudge-Progra version 0.023
================================

 Progra is an online judge capable of compile and test programs
 written to solve a programming task. 


 PREREQUISITES

  Cwd
  Proc::Killall
  File::Spec::Functions
  File::Copy
	
 Obviously, you will need the compilers and/or interpreters of the 
 languages you'll use (e.g. gcc, perl, g++). The main path structure 
 needed to use progra is as follows:

   - user_path/
   - task_path/
		- input.0
		- input.1
		...
		- input.n-1
		- output.0
		- output.1
		...
		- output.n-1
			
 The user_path and task_path must uniquely identify a user/task. The 
 user_path is used to store the output generated by the user's source 
 code. The task_path is used to store task's testcases. These testcases 
 must be consistent, meaning that there must be exactly the same number 
 of inputs and outputs. The naming of testcases is input./output. followed 
 by a number from 0 to n-1, n being the total number of testcases for 
 that particular task. The mapping between input and output is given by 
 this number. For example, input.0 is associated with output.0, input.1 
 with output.1 and so on.

 Once progra starts, it creates a .pid file in its home directory. To stop 
 it you should delete this file. There is a progra.sh file included in 
 case you need to automate this.

 Finally, remember thar source codes to be tested must interact with
 standard input and standard ouput.

 For more information look at the POD in Progra.pm.
